IP-swicher
==========

in the DOS env ,set to my ip address between the static addr and dhcp addr 
in two days later , i found that the bug of this script is displayed in the workplace .in case , our canpany 's IP mask is 255.255.252.0 ,it show me the three different net channal , it is 10.205.53 or 54 or 55 .for exmaple , if i set the key word of the 
findstr command to 10.205.53.,maybe happen to find the ip address is null or the gateway. i couldn't find the effect way to find the true ip address ,i test other ways to solve it ,it is a shame to disolve it.Auto have ot change to the hand way make me so anxious.
